# slow-and-reverbifier
Slow and Reverbifier is a program for slowing down and adding reverb to songs. This was done using Python, PyQt and Spotify's Pedalboard Library

### About the Slow and Reverb Genre
Slow and Reverb is a subgenre of Houston's Chopped and Screwed. Slow and Reverb, as the name suggests, involves slowing down a track and adding reverb to it.
This genre of music has gained popularity through Youtube and Tiktok.

### Lessons Learned
<ul>
  <li>
    Better understanding of how audio works:
    <ul>
      <li>For example, I didn't know that by changing the sample rate of a track, you change the playback speed of the audio.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Libraries like pedalboard are used by spotify to enchance their ML Models 
  </li>
  <li>
    Producers use libraries like these to manipulate/edit music without a DAW (garageband, FL Studio, Logic, etc)
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Better understanding of GUI Programming:
    <ul>
      <li>Tons of useful components in Qt's library for making UI's</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


### Next Steps

First I want to add more functionality to this GUI:
  - Being able to process multiple songs
  - Audio playback from the GUI

I also want to continue exploring audio manipulation and analysis. I want to do that through:
  - Making a slow and reverbifier web app
  - Playing around/learning more about the Pedalboard library
